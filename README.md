# Vibe Kibana

A design system and prototyping environment for Kibana experiences.

## Project Team

**Andrea Del Rio** ([@andreadelrio](https://github.com/andreadelrio)) - Project Lead  

## Features

### 🎨 Project Templates
Quickly spin up new projects using pre-built templates. Each template comes with a foundation of components and layouts, so you can focus on designing rather than setup.

### 🧩 Reusable Component Library
Access a curated set of shared components—charts, panels, controls, grids, and more—all built with Elastic UI. These components are ready to use and customize, helping you maintain consistency across your prototypes.

### 📚 Version History
Create and manage multiple versions of your project. Experiment with different approaches, compare iterations, and keep a history of your design evolution.

### 📋 Job Stories
Track job stories alongside your prototypes. Keep your design decisions grounded in user needs and maintain alignment with product goals.

### 📄 PRD Tracking
Document and reference product requirements directly within your project. Keep specs, context, and design work together in one place.

### ⚡ Auto-reload Development
Hot reloading for both frontend and backend during development. See your changes instantly without manual refreshes.

### 🎨 Modern UI
Built with Elastic UI (EUI) components for consistent design language and a polished look out of the box.

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **@elastic/eui** for UI components and design system
- **@elastic/charts** for data visualization
- **Webpack** with hot module replacement for development

### Backend
- **Express.js** server with TypeScript
- **@elastic/elasticsearch** client for database connectivity
- **CORS** enabled for cross-origin requests
- **Nodemon** for automatic server restarts during development

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Elasticsearch 8.x cluster running locally or remotely

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elastic/vibe-kibana.git
   cd vibe-kibana
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. **Start development servers:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3001 (with auto-reload)
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3000

## Creating New Projects

This repository supports automatic project discovery! Simply create a new folder under `src/public/pages/` with a version folder and component:

```bash
mkdir -p src/public/pages/my-new-project/v1.0
```

Then create `src/public/pages/my-new-project/v1.0/index.tsx` with your React component. Your project will automatically appear on the homepage at http://localhost:3001/

Alternatively you can create a project using the UI. Just go to the homepage (http://localhost:3001) and press "Create a project".

## Development Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start both frontend and backend with auto-reload |
| `npm run build` | Build production assets |
| `npm run start` | Start production server |
| `npm run build:server` | Build server TypeScript only |
| `npm run build:client` | Build client webpack bundle only |
| `npm test` | Run test suite |
